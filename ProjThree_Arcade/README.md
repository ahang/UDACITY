## About

UDACITY Project Three provided me with visual assets and a game loop engine. Using the tools I added a number of entities to the game including the player characters and enemies in order to recreate the classic arcade game Frogger.

#### GAME INSTRUCTIONS
In order to run the game, open index.html in your preferred web browser.
Using the arrow keys [Up, Down, Left, Right] the player's goal is to direct their character to the other side of the map by crossing a busy road full of bugs.
